## About PL/Java examples

The `pljava-examples` subproject builds the supplied examples; this
machine-generated page is a project summary for developers of PL/Java.

If you arrived here from a search for PL/Java examples, you probably want

[to browse the example sources][tbtes], or even [read their javadocs][rtj].
(Note: the source browser link shows the current development sources, which
may differ from a particular release.)
