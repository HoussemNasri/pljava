# Building on Mac OS X
#set($h2 = '##')

Given the Unix heritage of Mac OS X, the PL/Java
[build instructions](build.html) apply with few differences.
After installing a suitably recent Java Development Kit
([JDK, not just JRE][jdk8osx]) from Oracle, a quick  
  
`mvn -version`  
  
should confirm that it is installed, and is the version of Java
that Maven will use in the build.

$h2 El Capitan does not ship OpenSSL headers

As discussed [here][abotch]. On El Capitan, OpenSSL will have to be built,
or installed from [MacPorts][mp] or [Homebrew][hb].

If PostgreSQL itself was installed from MacPorts or Homebrew,
current package listings for both systems suggest that OpenSSL _should have_
been installed as a dependency. That should be checked if PL/Java fails
to compile.

[mp]: https://www.macports.org/index.php
[hb]: http://brew.sh/

Homebrew, it seems, will install the OpenSSL headers, but in a nonstandard
place. If so, for now, edit `pljava-so/pom.xml`, find the `<c>` compiler
`<includePaths>` section, and add another `<includePath>` for the nonstandard
location of the OpenSSL headers. See [issue 94][isu94] for more.

$h2 Note the PL/Java shared object name

On OS X, the shared object file that results from the build will have a name
that ends in `.bundle`. Because `.bundle` is not a suffix the PostgreSQL `LOAD`
command automatically tries, it must be spelled out in full:

    LOAD 'libpljava-so-${project.version}.bundle';

As always, unless the file is installed in `$libdir` or in one of the
directories named in `dynamic_library_path`, then the `LOAD` command must
also be given the path to the file.

$h2 No need to edit JDK task capabilities

Apple's Java framework allows Java installations to be selectively enabled
for five different types of task: `Applets`, `WebStart`, `BundledApp`,
`JNI`, and `CommandLine`, as documented for Apple's [`java_home`][jh] tool.

[jh]: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/java_home.1.html

Some procedures have been posted for editing an `Info.plist` file after
installing Oracle's Java to enable it for additional task types.
**Nothing of the sort is needed for PL/Java**, because PL/Java does not use
the Apple Java framework to locate the Java runtime. Instead, you simply
set PostgreSQL's `pljava.libjvm_location` variable to identify the exact
`libjvm.dylib` that PL/Java will use.

For example, if the `mvn -v` shows "Java home" to be  
`/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_65.jdk/Contents/Home/jre`  
then you will probably set `pljava.libjvm_location` so:

    SET pljava.libjvm_location TO
    '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_65.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/server/libjvm.dylib`;

$h2 Troubleshooting the build

On OS X, it seems the `-Pwnosign` Maven build option does not succeed in
suppressing the many useless sign-conversion warnings, so if the build does
fail, it can be difficult to find the real problem because of so many
surrounding messages. One technique is to direct the `mvn -X -Dnar.cores=1 clean
install` output into a file, then search that file for the strings `fatal error`
or `error generated`.
